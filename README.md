# Synthetix Router Proxy template

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test --network hardhat
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test --network hardhat
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat cannon:deploy --network hardhat
```
